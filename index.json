Nevertheless, the literature on trimetallic borohydrides is limited to only a few studied examples. Thermodynamic properties of trimetallic borohydrides can be tuned by changing the composition and stoichiometry of the compound. In this regard, the hydrogen storage potential of a series of new Al-based trimetallic borohydrides, including alkali, earth alkali, and transition metals with different electronegativities, with a general formula of LiAlM(BH4)5‚Äì7 (M = Na, Mg, Sc, Y, Zn, and Mo) has been investigated using various computational tools. Due to the limited knowledge about the crystal structure of trimetallic borohydrides, first, a crystal structure prediction study has been accomplished to determine the lowest-energy crystal structures of Al-based trimetallic borohydrides using the recently developed highly parallel FFCASP tool together with subsequent electronic structure calculations. Iso-energetic crystal structures with different metal-borohydride coordinations were obtained with FFCASP especially for the higher borohydride stoichiometries, indicating a potential energy landscape with shallow minima, which make easier the phase transformations under temperature. The convex hull of the ternary LiBH4‚ÄìAl(BH4)3-M(BH4)x (M = Na, Mg, Zn, and Y) system indicated that while both LiAlNa(BH4)5 and LiAlZn(BH4)6 are stable, LiAlMg(BH4)6 and LiAlY(BH4)7 are metastable. Hydrogen release dynamics in these predicted structures was studied with the help of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Among the trimetallic borohydrides, AIMD simulations indicated that LiAlZn(BH4)6 has a favorable hydrogen release temperature, starting from 392 K.","tags":["Hydrogen Storage","Computational Material Design"],"title":"Hydrogen Storage in Trimetallic Borohydrides: a Crystal Structure Prediction and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samet Demir","Gozde Inis Demir","Mehmet Cankaya","Adem Tekin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1694995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694995200,"objectID":"a9838044d440f6839118f81dd98fdc8e","permalink":"https://sametd.github.io/publication/sr/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sr/","section":"publication","summary":"Metal halide ammines are promising ammonia storage materials due to their high ammonia densities and suitable decomposition properties. Here, we studied the polymorphism of SrCl 2 ammines with a general formula of Sr(NH 3 ) n Cl 2 (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) by combining the Fast and Flexible CrystAl Structure Predictor (FFCASP) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the lattice stability and the minimum energy paths for bulk and surface diffusion of NH 3 were investigated by performing phonon and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. In addition to the successful reproduction of the reported experimental crystal structures of octammine (Pnma (IT number 62)), diammine (Aem2 (IT number 39)) and monoammine (Cmcm (IT number 63)), several isoenergetic polymorphs for each phase were also found. Not only the experimentally determined octammine and monoammine structures, but also the proposed structures for the hexammine and tetrammine phases were found to be metastable. While phonon calculations show unstability for the experimental diammine structure, some of the proposed structures for the diammine phase showed thermodynamical stability. Moreover, NEB paths examining the bulk and surface diffusion of NH3 are in accordance with the experimental desorption enthalpies.","tags":["Crystal Structure Prediction","Discovery of Energy Materials","Ammonia Storage Materials"],"title":"Stable and metastable crystal structures and ammonia dynamics in strontium chloride ammines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gozde Inis Demir","Samet Demir","Adem Tekin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661558400,"objectID":"432773bcf9acc8eaa0d6a5c49560db61","permalink":"https://sametd.github.io/publication/2dffcasp/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2dffcasp/","section":"publication","summary":"Biomolecular self-assembly on surfaces is an emerging and exciting field for the fabrication of 2D nanostructures that are being used in a wide range of applications. Self-assembly of the nucleic acid bases, which are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonding, in both solution and solid have been well characterized by various experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Especially for the surface based self assemblies, the resolution of STM images is quite insufficient to reveal the dominating intermolecular interactions which lead to the formation of self-assembled DNA bases. Moreover, it is also possible to form crystalline order self assemblies by finding suitable experimental conditions. This fact allows the application of crystal structure prediction (CSP) tools for the discovery of ordered self assemblies. In this regard, the existing CSP method called FFCASP has been extended with a new implementation allowing the prediction of 1D or 2D periodic and nonperiodic structures. The new approach, 2D-FFCASP, has been applied to four DNA bases and the best resulting structures have been further evaluated by dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) and cluster in a molecule local correlation approach at the second-order M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation (CIM-RI-MP2). 2D-FFCASP successfully reproduced the known self-assemblies of DNA bases in addition to many newly found isoenergetic structures.","tags":["2D Structure Prediction","2D Structures of DNA"],"title":"2D-FFCASP‚ÄîA New Approach for 2D Structure Prediction Applied to Self-Assemblies of DNA Bases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samet Demir","Adem Tekin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617753600,"objectID":"971107c67206d823d2c8d1f1b6b3f026","permalink":"https://sametd.github.io/publication/ffcasp/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ffcasp/","section":"publication","summary":"A new algorithm called Fast and Flexible CrystAl Structure Predictor (FFCASP) was developed to predict the structure of covalent and molecular crystals. FFCASP is massively parallel and able to handle more than 200 atoms in the unit cell (in other terms, it allows global optimization around 100 individual parameters). It uses a global optimizer specialized for Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) which combines particle swarm and simulated annealing optimizers. Three different molecular crystals, including diverse intermolecular interactions, namely, cytosine, coumarin, and pyrazinamide, have been selected to evaluate the performance of FFCASP. While cytosine polymorphs have been searched by employing two different force fields (a DFT-SAPT based intermolecular potential and generalized amber force field (GAFF)) up to Z = 16, only GAFF has been used both in coumarin and pyrazinamide polymorph searches up to Z = 4. For these three molecular crystals, FFCASP generated more than 20‚ÄØ000 crystal structures, and the unique ones have been further treated by DFT-D3. A combination of data mining and a machine learning approach was introduced to determine the unique structures and their distribution into different clusters, which ultimately gives an opportunity to retrieve the common features and relations between the resulting structures. There are two known experimental crystal structures of cytosine, and both were successfully located with FFCASP. Two of the reported crystal structures of coumarin have been reproduced. Similarly, in pyrazinamide, three known experimental structures have been rediscovered. In addition to finding the experimentally known structures, FFCASP also located other low-energy structures for each considered molecular crystals. These successes of FFCASP offer the possibility to discover the polymorphic nature of other important molecular crystals (e.g., drugs) as well.","tags":["Crystal Structure Prediction","Discovery of Energy Materials","Machine Learning"],"title":"FFCASP: A Massively Parallel Crystal Structure Prediction Algorithm","type":"publication"}]
